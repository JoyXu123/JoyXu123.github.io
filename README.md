My personal website has 3 internal links in my headerbar on top of my home page.
1. "Home" tab links to index.html
2. "Hobby&Interest" tab links to hobby.html
3. "CV" tab links to my resume.pdf.


How bullet points are addressed.
1. Landing page is the index.html.
2. Navigational element is the header bar on top of the index.html; in hobby.html, we can return to Home page with the link <home>.
3. Two or more internal links: link to hobby.html and link to resume.pdf.
4. Two or more external links are:
- "Network Science" links to Network Science Institute website.
- "Tina Eliassi-rad" links to my advisor's home page.
- all kinds of project points link to my external project page on github.
(All these links open a new tab)
