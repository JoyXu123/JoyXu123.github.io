How bullet points are addressed.
1. Landing page is the index.html.
2. Navigational element is the header bar on top of the index.html; in hobby.html, we can return to Home page with the link <home>.
3. Two or more internal links: link to hobby.html and link to resume.pdf.
4. Two or more external links are:
- "Network Science" links to Network Science Institute website.
- "Tina Eliassi-rad" links to my advisor's home page.
- all kinds of project points link to my external project page on github.
(All these links open a new tab)
5. HTML Table with CSS Styling is used in "Online Courses Taken" Section.
6. Interactive Component is added in hobby.html. Whenever my curser moves to a new division of my hobby, the new division will be highlighted in grey.
7. I have used the media query in css to make sure my personal website can be displayed properly on all types of devices.
