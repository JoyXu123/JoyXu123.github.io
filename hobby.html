            <li>Nutrition Made Clear, published by the Great Course Company.</li>
            <li>The Science of Exercise, an online course from Courseara</li>

        <h2>Swimming</h2>
        I am an avid swimmer. Before the pandemic, I swam at least once every week. 
        I used to form some small swimming club with friends during college and master study.
        I have not been able to do so in my PhD study here.
