			<h3>I am a graduate student in Computer Science in UCLA.
				My research interests are in Machine Learning, Data mining and Algorithms. I am interested in designing and applying Machine Learning algorithms, especially interested in combining Machine Learning methods with traditional algorithms and existing methods in innovative fields, such as interaction between multi-agents. I am also interested in developing models for estimation and prediction.

				I get my bachelor degree with a major in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science from University of Michigan in 2014. Before going back to graduate school in UCLA Computer Science, I worked as actuary in Asset Liability Management Department in Sun Life Financial in Boston Metropolitan Area.</h3>

		  <h2>Project</h2>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Software Construction Project: convert research PDFs into audio files so that users
		      can listen to research papers. Current text-to-speech tools also convert table contents, headers and footnotes 
		      to audios, causing users unable to make sense of the research paper contents. Our tool identify and get rid of
		      urls, headers, footnotes, and math formulars, thus the comprehension of users on research paper contents improves.
		      Future work can be done: how to sensibly read math formulars to users using automatic text-to-speech tools.
